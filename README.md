# BlockTalk

An AI-powered blockchain explorer, that let's you interact, learn, and talk with the Solana blockchain.

## About

**The advent of AI, has started to change the way we seek and consume information.** Platforms like ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini make it easier than ever to search, summarize and even explain any topic or subject.

Using them you can chat with articles, videos, PDFs, etc. But there isn't a way to talk to the Blockchain directly... until now.

BlockTalk was built for the Solana Renaissance Hackathon.

## Quickstart

To get started, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and input your own variables, or visit [BlockTalk Demo](https://blocktalk-demo.vercel.app/).

**DISCLAIMER:** The demo is hosted on Vercel with a free account, meaning requests will timeout after 20 seconds without an answer, LLM responses may take more 20 seconds to generate. For the best experience, run the repository locally with your own environment variables.

## Roadmap/Future Plans

BlockTalk is still in it's early stages, it works has a proof of concept of teaching an LLM how to use and interact with a blockchain. However is still missing many features, in future iterations we intend in adding:

- More blockchains
- More tools and advanced interactions (e.g: Swaps in chat, cross-referencing).
- Better UI
